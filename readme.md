- This is a comprehensive repo to learn javascript. As of writing this md (15-05-2024), I'm still learning javascript.
  I'm updating the repo as I go along.

- I have numbered the directories according to the order you should learn javascript. You should only access the #\_ImportantConcetps directory once you are done with 02_Math.
