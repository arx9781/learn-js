In JavaScript, you have three main keywords to declare variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. They determine how your variables are stored and accessed in your code. Here's a quick breakdown of their differences:

**Scope:**

- `var`: These variables are scoped to the entire function they are declared in, or globally if outside any function. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful.
- `let` and `const`: These are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block (code wrapped in curly braces `{}`) where they are declared. This makes your code more predictable and avoids conflicts.

**Reassignment and Redeclaration:**

- `var`: You can freely reassign and redeclare `var` variables within their scope.
- `let`: You can reassign the value of a `let` variable, but you cannot redeclare it within the same block.
- `const`: These variables are constant, meaning their value cannot be changed after they are initially assigned. You also must assign a value during the declaration.

**Hoisting:**

- `var`: Interestingly, `var` variables are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means you can access them even before they are declared in your code, which can lead to errors.
- `let` and `const`: These are not hoisted. You cannot access them before they are declared in their block.

**Best Practices:**

In modern JavaScript, it's generally recommended to use `const` by default for variables that don't need to be reassigned. If you do need to reassign a variable, use `let`. Avoid using `var` due to its potential for confusion.
